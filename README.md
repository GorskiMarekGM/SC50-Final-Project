Welcome to my final project – “Verona restaurant”

My website is for users who lives close to restaurant, it allows them to order food to their houses, or collecting it personally in restaurant. Moreover users can browse whole menu, they can also add items to cart even when they are not logged in. Cart stores all their data in cookies, so even if they close browser, they still have their orders.

When you arrive at the homepage you can see the big slider with the photos of the restaurant. You can also see current meal of the day, which is special for every week. And a little description of the restaurant which changes during special events. In information part, you can see two cards which links to contact, and events pages. You can also see current recommendations, and the location of restaurant on google maps.

Menu page displays all of the meals, and after you click them they display additional information about that meal for example ingredients, description, price. At the top of the screen you can search for particular dish.

In the upper right corner you can see the cart icon, when you click it you will be directed to cart page, where all your orders are displayed, you can live edit the quantity of the products or change pizza size. From this page you can go further to checkout or go back to menu. Before moving to checkout user will be asked to add additional information about address in order to calculate delivery distance.

This is all about my website, hope you enjoy
